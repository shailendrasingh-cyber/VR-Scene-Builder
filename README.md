# VR-Scene-Builder

This web application allows users to create and customize VR scenes using A-Frame and Streamlit. Users can select various A-Frame primitives, lights, environments, and optional fog settings to generate their VR scenes dynamically.

## Features

- Choose from various A-Frame primitives (e.g., `a-box`, `a-sphere`, `a-cylinder`, `a-cone`, `a-torus-knot`, `a-ring`, `a-dodecahedron`, `a-icosahedron`).
- Customize the type of light in the scene.
- Select different environment presets.
- Optionally add fog to the scene.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/streamlit-aframe-vr-app.git
    cd streamlit-aframe-vr-app
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Streamlit app in your browser.
2. Use the sidebar to select the A-Frame primitive, light type, environment preset, and fog option.
3. The generated VR scene will be displayed along with the corresponding HTML code.
4. You can copy the HTML code and use it in your own A-Frame projects.
